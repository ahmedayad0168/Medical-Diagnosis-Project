Damaged lung tissue is more likely to collapse. Lung damage can be caused by many types of underlying diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, lung cancer or pneumonia. Cystic lung diseases, such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, cause round, thin-walled air sacs in the lung tissue that can rupture, resulting in pneumothorax. Ruptured air blisters. Small air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the lungs. These air blisters sometimes burst — allowing air to leak into the space that surrounds the lungs. Mechanical ventilation. A severe type of pneumothorax can occur in people who need mechanical assistance to breathe. The ventilator can create an imbalance of air pressure within the chest.

      "Overview:\n",
      "Burning mouth syndrome is the medical term for ongoing or recurring burning in the mouth without an obvious cause. You may feel this burning on your tongue, gums, lips, inside of your cheeks, roof of your mouth or large areas of your whole mouth. The feeling of burning can be severe, as if you injured your mouth with a very hot drink.  Burning mouth syndrome usually comes on suddenly, but it can develop slowly over time. Often the specific cause can't be found. Although that makes treatment more challenging, working closely with your health care team can help you reduce symptoms.

      "Symptoms:\n",
      "Symptoms of burning mouth syndrome may include: A burning or scalding feeling that most commonly affects your tongue, but also may affect your lips, gums, roof of your mouth, throat or whole mouth. A feeling of dry mouth with increased thirst. Taste changes in your mouth, such as a bitter or metallic taste. Loss of taste. Tingling, stinging or numbness in your mouth. The discomfort from burning mouth syndrome can have several different patterns. It may: Happen every day, with little discomfort when waking up, but become worse as the day goes on. Start as soon as you wake up and last all day. Come and go. Whatever pattern of mouth discomfort you have, burning mouth syndrome may last for months to years. In rare cases, symptoms may suddenly go away on their own or happen less often. Sometimes the burning feeling may be briefly relieved during eating or drinking. Burning mouth syndrome usually doesn't cause any physical changes to your tongue or mouth that can be seen. When to see a doctor If you have discomfort, burning or soreness of your tongue, lips, gums or other areas of your mouth, see your health care provider or dentist. They may need to work together to help pinpoint a cause and come up with an effective treatment plan. Request an appointment There is a problem with\n",

      "Causes:\n",
      "The cause of burning mouth syndrome may be primary or secondary. Primary burning mouth syndrome When the cause can't be found, the condition is called primary or idiopathic burning mouth syndrome. Some research suggests that primary burning mouth syndrome is related to problems with the nerves involved with taste and pain. Secondary burning mouth syndrome Sometimes burning mouth syndrome is caused by an underlying medical condition. In these cases, it's called secondary burning mouth syndrome. Underlying problems that may be linked to secondary burning mouth syndrome include: Dry mouth, which can be caused by some medicines, health problems, problems with the glands that make saliva or the side effects of cancer treatment. Other oral conditions, such as a fungal infection of the mouth called oral thrush, an inflammatory condition called oral lichen planus or a condition called geographic tongue that gives the tongue a maplike appearance. Not getting enough nutrients, such as a lack of iron, zinc, folate (vitamin B-9), thiamin (vitamin B-1), riboflavin (vitamin B-2), pyridoxine (vitamin B-6) and cobalamin (vitamin B-12). Allergies or reactions to foods, food flavorings, other food additives, fragrances or dyes, dental materials, or mouth care products. Reflux of stomach acid that enters your mouth from your stomach, also called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Certain medicines, especially high blood pressure medicines. Oral habits, such as pushing your tongue against your teeth, biting the tip of your tongue, and grinding or clenching your teeth. Endocrine disorders, such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid known as hypothyroidism. A very irritated mouth, which may result from brushing your tongue too much or too hard, using abrasive toothpastes, overusing mouthwashes, or having too many acidic foods or drinks. Dentures that don't fit well may cause irritation that can make symptoms worse. Psychological issues, such as anxiety, depression or stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk Factors:\n",
      "Burning mouth syndrome is uncommon. However, your risk may be greater if you're: Female. In perimenopause or you're postmenopausal. Over the age of 50. A smoker. Burning mouth syndrome usually starts suddenly, for no known reason. But certain factors may increase your risk of developing burning mouth syndrome, including: Recent illness. Some long-term medical conditions such as fibromyalgia, Parkinson's disease, autoimmune disorders and neuropathy. Previous dental work. Allergic reactions to food. Certain medicines. Traumatic life events. Stress. Anxiety. Depression.\n",

      "\n",
      "Overview: Atrial fibrillation Enlarge image Close Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a heart rhythm disorder. In a typical heart, a group of cells called the sinus node sends electrical signals that start each heartbeat. The signals go across the upper heart chambers to the AV node, where they usually slow down. Then the signals go to the lower heart chambers, causing them to squeeze and pump out blood. But in AFib, the signals in the upper chambers are chaotic. The AV node can't stop all of the chaotic signals from entering the lower chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heartbeat. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia. AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.  During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers, called the atria, beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness. Some people don't notice symptoms. Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be constant. AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke. Treatment for AFib may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals. A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm disorder called atrial flutter. The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.

      "Overview: Collapsed and normal lung Enlarge image Close Collapsed and normal lung Collapsed and normal lung In a collapsed lung, air from the lung leaks into the chest cavity. The example shown is a complete left pneumothorax. A pneumothorax (noo-moe-THOR-aks) is a collapsed lung. A pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall. This air pushes on the outside of your lung and makes it collapse. A pneumothorax can be a complete lung collapse or a collapse of only a portion of the lung.  A pneumothorax can be caused by a blunt or penetrating chest injury, certain medical procedures, or damage from underlying lung disease. Or it may occur for no obvious reason. Symptoms usually include sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. On some occasions, a collapsed lung can be a life-threatening event. Treatment for a pneumothorax usually involves inserting a needle or chest tube between the ribs to remove the excess air. However, a small pneumothorax may heal on its own.

      "Things that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib) include: Age. The risk of AFib increases as you grow older. Caffeine, nicotine or illegal drug use. Caffeine, nicotine and some illegal drugs — such as amphetamines and cocaine — can cause your heart to beat faster. Use of these substances may lead to the development of more-serious irregular heartbeats. Drinking too much alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart and cause an irregular heartbeat. Changes in the level of body minerals. Minerals in the blood called electrolytes help the heart beat. They include potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium. If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur. Family history. An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families. Heart conditions or heart surgery. Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and heart conditions present at birth increase the risk of AFib. A history of heart attack or heart surgery also makes a person more likely to get the condition. High blood pressure. Over time, high blood pressure may cause part of the heart to become stiff and thick. This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart. Obesity. People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation. Other long-term health conditions. You may be more likely to get AFib if you have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea. Some medicines and supplements. Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold remedies bought without a prescription can cause irregular heartbeats. Thyroid disease. Having an overactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats.\n",

The type of pneumothorax caused by ruptured air blisters is most likely to occur in people between 20 and 40 years old, especially if the person is very tall and underweight. Underlying lung disease or mechanical ventilation can be a cause or a risk factor for a pneumothorax. Other risk factors include: Smoking. The risk increases with the length of time and the number of cigarettes smoked, even without emphysema. Genetics. Certain types of pneumothorax appear to run in families. Previous pneumothorax. Anyone who has had one pneumothorax is at increased risk of another.\n"

      "\n",
      "Causes: A pneumothorax can be caused by: Chest injury. Any blunt or penetrating injury to your chest can cause lung collapse. Some injuries may happen during physical assaults or car crashes, while others may inadvertently occur during medical procedures that involve the insertion of a needle into the chest. Lung disease. Damaged lung tissue is more likely to collapse. Lung damage can be caused by many types of underlying diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, lung cancer or pneumonia. Cystic lung diseases, such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, cause round, thin-walled air sacs in the lung tissue that can rupture, resulting in pneumothorax. Ruptured air blisters. Small air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the lungs. These air blisters sometimes burst — allowing air to leak into the space that surrounds the lungs. Mechanical ventilation. A severe type of pneumothorax can occur in people who need mechanical assistance to breathe. The ventilator can create an imbalance of air pressure within the chest. The lung may collapse completely.\n",
      "Disease: Atrial fibrillation\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview: Atrial fibrillation Enlarge image Close Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a heart rhythm disorder. In a typical heart, a group of cells called the sinus node sends electrical signals that start each heartbeat. The signals go across the upper heart chambers to the AV node, where they usually slow down. Then the signals go to the lower heart chambers, causing them to squeeze and pump out blood. But in AFib, the signals in the upper chambers are chaotic. The AV node can't stop all of the chaotic signals from entering the lower chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heartbeat. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia. AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.  During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers, called the atria, beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness. Some people don't notice symptoms. Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be constant. AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke. Treatment for AFib may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals. A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm disorder called atrial flutter. The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.

      "Causes: A pneumothorax can be caused by: Chest injury. Any blunt or penetrating injury to your chest can cause lung collapse. Some injuries may happen during physical assaults or car crashes, while others may inadvertently occur during medical procedures that involve the insertion of a needle into the chest. Lung disease. Damaged lung tissue is more likely to collapse. Lung damage can be caused by many types of underlying diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, lung cancer or pneumonia. Cystic lung diseases, such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, cause round, thin-walled air sacs in the lung tissue that can rupture, resulting in pneumothorax. Ruptured air blisters. Small air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the lungs. These air blisters sometimes burst — allowing air to leak into the space that surrounds the lungs. Mechanical ventilation. A severe type of pneumothorax can occur in people who need mechanical assistance to breathe. The ventilator can create an imbalance of air pressure within the chest. The lung may collapse completely.\n",
      "Disease: Atrial fibrillation\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview: Atrial fibrillation Enlarge image Close Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a heart rhythm disorder. In a typical heart, a group of cells called the sinus node sends electrical signals that start each heartbeat. The signals go across the upper heart chambers to the AV node, where they usually slow down. Then the signals go to the lower heart chambers, causing them to squeeze and pump out blood. But in AFib, the signals in the upper chambers are chaotic. The AV node can't stop all of the chaotic signals from entering the lower chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heartbeat. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia. AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.  During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers, called the atria, beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness. Some people don't notice symptoms. Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be constant. AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke. Treatment for AFib may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals. A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm disorder called atrial flutter. The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.

      "Overview: A pinched nerve occurs when too much pressure is applied to a nerve by surrounding tissues, such as bones, cartilage, muscles or tendons. This pressure can cause pain, tingling, numbness or weakness. A pinched nerve can occur in many areas of the body. For example, a herniated disk in the lower spine may put pressure on a nerve root. This may cause pain that radiates down the back of the leg. A pinched nerve in the wrist can lead to pain and numbness in the hand and fingers, known as carpal tunnel syndrome.  With rest and other conservative treatments, most people recover from a pinched nerve within a few days or weeks. Sometimes, surgery is needed to relieve pain from a pinched nerve.

A pinched nerve occurs when too much pressure, known as compression, is applied to a nerve by surrounding tissues. This tissue might be bone or cartilage, such as when a herniated spinal disk compresses a nerve root. Or muscle or tendons may compress a nerve. In carpal tunnel syndrome, a variety of tissues may be responsible for compression of the carpal tunnel's median nerve in the wrist. It can be caused by swollen tendon sheaths within the tunnel, enlarged bone that narrows the tunnel, or a thickened and degenerated ligament. A number of conditions may cause tissue to compress a nerve or nerves, including: Injury. Rheumatoid or wrist arthritis. Stress from repetitive work. Hobbies or sports. Obesity. If a nerve is pinched for only a short time, there's often no permanent damage. Once the pressure is relieved, nerve function returns. However, if the pressure continues, chronic pain and permanent nerve damage can occur.\n"
