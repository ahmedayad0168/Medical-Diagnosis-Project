      "SECTION: Overview\n",
      "Atrial fibrillation Enlarge image Close Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a heart rhythm disorder. In a typical heart, a group of cells called the sinus node sends electrical signals that start each heartbeat. The signals go across the upper heart chambers to the AV node, where they usually slow down. Then the signals go to the lower heart chambers, causing them to squeeze and pump out blood. But in AFib, the signals in the upper chambers are chaotic. The AV n\n",

      "SECTION: Symptoms\n",
      "Symptoms of atrial fibrillation (AFib) may include: A fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations. Chest pain. Dizziness. Fatigue. Lightheadedness. Reduced ability to exercise. Shortness of breath. Weakness. Some people with AFib don't notice any symptoms. Atrial fibrillation may be: Occasional, also called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. AFib symptoms come and go. The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours. Some people have symptoms for as long as a week. The irregular\n",

      "SECTION: Causes\n",
      "To understand the causes of atrial fibrillation (AFib), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats. The heart has four chambers: The two upper chambers are called the atria. The two lower chambers are called the ventricles. Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node makes the signals that start each heartbeat. The signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called the AV node, where th\n",

      "SECTION: Risk factors\n",
      "Things that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib) include: Age. The risk of AFib increases as you grow older. Caffeine, nicotine or illegal drug use. Caffeine, nicotine and some illegal drugs — such as amphetamines and cocaine — can cause your heart to beat faster. Use of these substances may lead to the development of more-serious irregular heartbeats. Drinking too much alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart and cause an irregular heartbe\n",
